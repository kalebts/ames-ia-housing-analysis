## Kaleb Tsegaye DSI Project 2 Repo


### Purpose

The purpose of my analysis is to portray how certain changes could add to or deter from property sale prices in Ames, Iowa. I am specifically targeting my findings to property owners in Ames with assessed values below median property sale price. I aim to share insight on which features of their property to should consider to surpass that level. The way I examined this is based on information provided by the Ames Assessor’s Office. The dataset I am using includes information on dozens of features compiled from over nearly 3000 sales from 2006 to 2010. To examine these relationships, I used exploratory data analysis methods/visualizations and several linear regression algorithms to determine if there is a linear relationship between property features and sale price.

### Conclusion/Limitations

- In conclusion, if you would like to increase the potential sale price for your property, consider factors like your heating system, electrical system, and ground/garage living area
- Quality assessments by the Ames Assessor’s office play a big role in the prediction of sale price. If time permits, request reassessment for changes on your property during the annual assessment period.
- And lastly, accept that certain features about your property may limit its potential, like its proximity to certain features. Despite this, there are likely accessible changes to be made.
- Attempts to identify interaction terms (like between neighborhood and certain property features) should be added to improve model and results
